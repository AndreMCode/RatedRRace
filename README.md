An auto-runner style game in which the player aims to dodge oncoming
obstacles by utilizing three basic moves: jump, slide, and dive.
The player must overcome three levels of unique obstacle placement

purchase protective shields with money that is earned upon death.
Box obstacles offer a cash bonus incentive to break them from above.
Endless mode tracks the player's best run (distance) and will often
spam waves of a single obstacle type at disctances over 1000 meters.
